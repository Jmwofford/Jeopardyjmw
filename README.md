<!-- <!-- A Project description -->

Jeopardy is Single Player board game that allows the user to dynamically answer trivia questions while having fun interactive user experience. This game allows the user to choose themes and point values based on their understanding of each topic.c
The game ends after the Player gains 5500 and they are taken to a win screen.

Using Flexbox i create rows and colums for gameboard. I created an array of objects for each category. Used Jquery to select id and classes and dynamically edit/alter div. Used OOP to change elements within divs to make visiual display changes.
Really Enjoyed this Experience will look to Improve Features for Final Display Soon. StayTuned.
